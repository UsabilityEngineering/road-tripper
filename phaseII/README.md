# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

# Introduction

Phase 2 welcomed many necessary changes that allowed the functionality of the app to run more efficiently. To do so we created wireframes from the sketchs and mapping of phase 1. With the use of these wireframes we were able to conduct a congnitve walkthrough with the help of our peers as the personas trying to complete a task. From their feedback, we were able to notice some funcionality that needed to be tweaked. These changes include a dedicated navigation bar for the different pages to ensure ease when navigating through each page and having a dedicated explore page, was another feature that arose from these cognative walkthroughs.

# Methods

## Cognative Walk throughs
A cognitive walkthrough is a task-based usability-inspection method that involves a crossfunctional team of reviewers walking through each step of a task flow and answering a set of prescribed questions, with the goal of identifying those aspects of the interface that could be challenging to new users.

Through our cognative walkthrough workshop our peers had a end goal that pertained to a specific persona and scenario of their choice. Although our walk throughs did not go as planned, we gained a lot of valuable information. Our Wireframes were set up in a prototype way so the buttons were functional and led to other pages. Our reviewers did not know this so they were getting different pages than those we expected them to go through. Having our reviewers go through the exercise was not a cake walk. in our feed back from our reviewers we were able to recreate the steps they took to complete the end goal. We noticed that most of the reviewers had no sense of direction, and it did not work well with their mental models. we found many challenging hurdles that would need to be changed in order to make this a easy flowing application. 

In a different walkthrough conduncted from jackson johanssens POV another problem arose, Jackson wanted to have a day packed with fun activites so that he and his friend can go explore the different things around his surrounding city. There was no way Jackson could complete this task in a seamless manner. What we found most interesting was that jackson had no plan to plan a road trip. instead he wanted to plan an itinary for the day so he and his friend can enjoy the surrounding activites. That being said this was not a cake walk, through the walk through jackson completly gave up and deleted the application.
Through this we were able find a new target audience, users who want to plan an itinnary from surrounding citys or towns. Through this discovery we decided to make a dedicated explore page with different filters to fit the users needs.


# Findings

First thing we learned from phase 2 was that our app layout wasnt as good as we thought.
- we need a way to tell what page a certain user is on
- we want to have dedicated pages for certain scenarios like an explore page 
  - with dedicated filters to have a unique trip or itinerary
  - pre planned trips fitting certain criteria
- Having an inital planned out flow of our application is a good start, but is no where near to finished.
 - througth the cognative walk trhough we were able to make sense of what a better flow would look like, because not always what works for yuo will work for others.

# Conclusion

Throught the use of wireframes we were able to gain feedback from our peers, and with their troubles of navigating our "well thought out layout of our app" we found some changes that could be of great benefit. Having the feed back from Mr. Buffardi we found a new feature that could be implemented to capture a wider audience. Phase 2 was a big realization of not everything you create is the best it could be, and through collaberation it could be significantlly improved for the wider audience (not yourself).
