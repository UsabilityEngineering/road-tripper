# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

# Introduction

Phase 2 welcomed many necessary changes that allowed the functionality of the app to run more efficiently. To do so we created wireframes that would allow users to go through different scenarios with the app to see if they ran by any issues. With the use of these wireframes we were able to conduct a congnitve walkthrough with the help of our peers as the personas trying to complete a task. From their feedback, we were able to notice some funcionality that needed to be tweaked. These changes include a dedicated navigation bar for the different pages to ensure ease when navigating through each page and having a dedicated explore page, was another feature that arose from these cognative walkthroughs.
