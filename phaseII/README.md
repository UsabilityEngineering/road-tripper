# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

# Introduction

Phase 2 welcomed many necessary changes that allowed the functionality of the app to run more efficiently. To do so we created wireframes from the sketches and mapping of phase 1. With the use of these wireframes, we were able to conduct a cognitive walkthrough with the help of our peers as the personas trying to complete a task. From their feedback, we were able to notice some functionality that needed to be tweaked. These changes include a dedicated navigation bar for the different pages to ensure ease when navigating through each page and having a dedicated explore page, which was another feature that arose from these cognitive walkthroughs.

# Methods

## Cognitive Walkthroughs
A cognitive walkthrough is a task-based usability-inspection method that involves a crossfunctional team of reviewers walking through each step of a task flow and answering a set of prescribed questions, intending to identify those aspects of the interface that could be challenging to new users.
Through our cognitive walkthrough workshop, our peers had an end goal that pertained to a specific persona and scenario of their choice. Although our walk-throughs did not go as planned, we gained a lot of valuable information. Our Wireframes were set up in a prototype way so the buttons were functional and led to other pages. Our reviewers did not know this so they were getting different pages than those we expected them to go through. Having our reviewers go through the exercise was not a cakewalk. in our feedback from our reviewers, we were able to recreate the steps they took to complete the end goal. We noticed that most of the reviewers had no sense of direction, which did not work well with their mental models. we found many challenging hurdles that would need to be changed to make this an easy-flowing application.
In a different walkthrough conducted from Jackson Johanssen's POV another problem arose, Jackson wanted to have a day packed with fun activities so that he and his friend can go explore the different things around his surrounding city. There was no way Jackson could seamlessly complete this task. What we found most interesting was that Jackson had no plan to plan a road trip. instead, he wanted to design an itinerary for the day so he and his friend can enjoy the surrounding activities. That being said this was not a cakewalk, through the walkthrough Jackson completely gave up and deleted the application. Through this, we were able to find a new target audience, users who want to plan an itinerary from surrounding cities or towns. Through this discovery, we decided to make a dedicated explore page with different filters to fit the user's needs.


# Findings

- The first thing we learned from phase 2 was that our app layout wasn't as good as we thought.
  - We need a way to tell what page a certain user is on
- We want to have dedicated pages for certain scenarios like an explore page
  - with dedicated filters to have a unique trip or itinerary
  - pre-planned trips fitting certain criteria
- Having an initially planned out flow of our application is a good start, but it is nowhere near finished.
through cognitive walk-throughs, we were able to make sense of what a better flow would look like, because not always what works for you will work for others.

# Conclusion

Through the use of wireframes we were able to gain feedback from our peers, and with their troubles navigating the "well-thought-out layout of our app" we found some changes that could be of great benefit. Having the feedback from Mr. Buffardi we found a new feature that could be implemented to capture a wider audience. Phase 2 was a big realization of not everything you create is the best it could be, and through collaboration, it could be significantly improved for the wider audience (not yourself).
