# Cake Trip

Cake Trip is geared towards the average adventurer. The applicationâ€™s main features are geared toward helping travelers plan their road trips and predict costs, using great UI. Precisely calculating or estimating costs in multiple levels of detail depending on the information imputed by the adventurer. Cake Trip allows the discovery of different activities and events for the road trip. The driving design of this is to enable users to use as much or as little of the application while still having a complete experience. Our goal is to make road tripping accessible to everyone and to get more people to discover all the wonderful things in life.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* **Conducted competitive analysis** which allowed us to understand the currently available applications along with their strengths and weaknesses.:
<u> Multi filter choice</u>: User is **not able to select multiple filters to show on the map.**  
<u> Planning page </u>: Planning page was visually busy and may cause a feeling of overwhelming
* Conducted a heuristic evaluation on our primary competitor to better understand their viability in calculating the price of a trip.
* **Constructed [personas](personas/README.md#personas)** to understand use cases and to put a face to the types of users we will have and put them through [scenarios](personas/README.md#scenarios) to see how they might want to use our application.
* **Developed diagrams** to workshop the workflow of our application.
* Developed sketches to get a viable user interface idea.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

During phase 2, we have created wire frames based on personas and scenarios.
With these wireframes a cognitive walkthrough was conducted by our peers. With the
feedback from our peers we realized different things that we needed to change, like
having a dedicated navigation bar for the different pages. Through the cognitive walk
through some users were experiencing difficulty navigating the different pages.
Something unexpected happened where the wire frames were out of order and they
weren't viewed the way we intended them to be. We figured out that there was no way
of knowing where a user was during a workflow, so this led us to make a change in our
wireframe design to add a dedicated navigation bar.
