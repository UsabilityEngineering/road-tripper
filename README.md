# Cake Trip

Cake Trip is geared towards the average adventurer. The applicationâ€™s main features are geared toward helping travelers plan their road trips and predict costs, using great UI. Precisely calculating or estimating costs in multiple levels of detail depending on the information imputed by the adventurer. Cake Trip allows the discovery of different activities and events for the road trip. The driving design of this is to enable users to use as much or as little of the application while still having a complete experience. Our goal is to make road tripping accessible to everyone and to get more people to discover all the wonderful things in life.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* **Conducted competitive analysis** which allowed us to understand the currently available applications along with their strengths and weaknesses.:
<u> Multi filter choice</u>: User is **not able to select multiple filters to show on the map.**  
<u> Planning page </u>: Planning page was visually busy and may cause a feeling of overwhelming
* Conducted a heuristic evaluation on our primary competitor to better understand their viability in calculating the price of a trip.
* **Constructed [personas](personas/README.md#personas)** to understand use cases and to put a face to the types of users we will have and put them through [scenarios](personas/README.md#scenarios) to see how they might want to use our application.
* **Developed diagrams** to workshop the workflow of our application.
* Developed sketches to get a viable user interface idea.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

Through cognative walkthroughs we were able to find flaws in the wireframes we initially made
 - some of our findings included having a dedicated nav bar, and dedicated explore page.
