# Scenarios

## Sherry Longbottom - Done with work and planned a weekend road trip
Sherry after having a short day of work because there isn't too much work on
Fridays she gets the kids ready for a 2-night road trip to the sawtooth lake. She packs the
camper with all the necessities (food, water, clothes, etc.) and gets the kids (18,
15, 10) to gather all their things. She then drives to the gas station to fill up for her 3 hr
road trip to the sawtooth mountains. On the way up she and the kids are karaoke
singing to Metalica, and green day, while the youngest is keeping busy on his GameBoy
advance.

## Jackson’s friend is coming to visit
Jackson’s friend Dave is flying in from London in a month. He wants to find a way
to schedule all the things they are going to do while he’s in America for the first time. He
specifically wants to feed Dave some biscuits and gravy which Dave says sounds like
one of the worst concepts birthed by humanity. He’ll be in town for a couple of weeks and
it’d be nice to see what events and activities are available while he’s in town.

## Conner Witts - He and his buddies are ready to begin their summer adventure
Conner finishes the last class of his junior year, and he and his buddies are
packing up their cars to go on a summer-long trip. Jehn meets Connor and his buddies
to take off for the road trip. They do basic mechanical checks on their cars to make sure
everything is topped off with oil levels, tire pressure, and bug wash for the windshield.
They plan on traveling to their first air BnB in Seattle Washington while seeing Crater
lake on the way up.
