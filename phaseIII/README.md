# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing
### Written by Peter Menzies and Steven Mendez
Phase 3 of our research study included gathering some participants to do a walkthrough of tasks that we created to see how our application would flow. Throughout this phase, we made a consent form that the test subjects had to sign before doing the study. The study consisted of 3 tasks and some pre-task questions regarding the history of traveling. The pre-task questions gave us insight into who the user was and their experience with traveling. This gave us an idea of the different websites they used to plan their road trip. The next tasks were given so that we could gain some insight into how the app flows and where the rough parts of the application were. We were able to recognize the parts that needed to be reworked in order for the user to have a better UI experience.

## Methods
For our study, we had a total of 5 participants. Our goal was to test every single part of the application through the 3 tasks we assigned. Each task was designed to go through specific features we have on the application. Through the test, we were able to see that some buttons were, or features were not visible. One important thing we did was run a usability test on both the competitor's app and our app. What we wanted to get out of this was to see the likes and dislikes of other applications, and compare those findings with our application to make improvements. One thing we found was that users did not like the competitor's app because it was too busy, and had lots of bugs. So we made sure to keep our application as minimal as possible while still delivering all the features of the competitor.

Task 1 
Now I want you to imagine you are planning a road trip for yourself and your
dog. You want to travel a maximum of 10 hours from your hometown of
Sacramento CA. you have a budget of 1000 dollars which includes gas,
campsites, food, and other miscellaneous expenses. Walk me through how you
would plan this road trip using the app.
  - The goal of this task was to get the user to test out the filters feature and navigate the map to find a destination. This was a really good question because it got the users to use the filters as well as the trip stats page to see how much money they would have spent going on this trip. There were some caveats as they were not able to make an actual itinerary and check the prices, so they had to use their imagination.


Task 2 
Imagine you’re taking a road trip with your significant other, and you all plan
on staying in major cities and towns along the west coast. You all also plan on
stopping by some major sightseeing places and going to all the popular food
stops. There is a $3500 Budget, you all are driving in a v6 jeep wrangler. The
starting point is San Diego
  - we wanted to get the user to try and use the gas feature that we implemented, but we found out that it wasn't easy to get to the actual page. We also found that some users disliked the idea of putting their car make and model in. They suggested that we ask for the avg miles per gallon instead. I could see this being a better route because users are less likely to input their car's make, model, and year. Having an estimation based on the MPG(average miles per gallon) was going to be a better and easier way to implement this feature.


Task 3 
Imagine your buddy from Colorado is flying down to Los Angeles CA to visit
you. You guys want something fun to do for the day, but are not great
planners. Try and quickly find something fun to do for you and your friend.
Note: order of navigation/features used AND mistakes or backtracking
Within the $1000 budget:
  - This task was an intent to get the users to use the explore feature. What we realized from this task was that are button was not visible, rather than being on the homepage users had to find it in one of the menu tabs. This feature was well-liked by participants. Some of the users suggested we add filters to this, for certain budgets, trip lengths, and group types. 


## Findings
### Background Question 0: Have you ever planned a road trip?
All but one of the users had planned a road trip

### Background Question 1: What are some of the tools used to book, plan, or organize this trip?
100% of the users tested used google maps to plan their road trips as well as at least one other application, but there was no overlap between the other applications between users.
The other applications listed were:
- Cross country
- Ways
- Tangible maps
- Booking
- Airbnb
- LA

Only one priority was listed from the user testing and that was to have the tools from the application printable or accessible without internet access.

### Background Question 2: Are there any features you would have liked to have to help you with your search?
Overall there was a theme of wanting help with the things to do on the journey. One wanted things to do, and another wanted alerts mid-journey, but the theme of assistance in event planning was key.

One big quote from one is "Maps are not the same as a road-tripping app." Having everything in one spot easy to access and helping the user every step of the way appears to be a need in the market.

### Background Question 3: Was Cost on your mind when you were planning it?

3/5 users tested stated that price was on their mind during the planning of their trip.

### Background Question 4: Did you spend more than you thought you would?

0/5 users spent more than they thought they would.

### Background Question 5: (If they haven’t planned a road trip) What type of road trip would you like to go on in the future?

No data was collected from this question

### Task 1:
Task one was run four times on our prototype and only once on our competitor Roadtrippers. 

#### Prototype
100%  Stayed within budget

This was fairly simple as people generally went for a simpler trip and didn't adventure too far out into an expensive trip. Perhaps in the future, we will either change the way this task is worded or remove this data point altogether.

50% were within the 10hr travel requirement

25% Completed the task

The only time this task was completed on the prototype was when the proctor took a more active role stepping in for the prototype to explain what theoretically should be happening.

#### Roadtrippers
The task was not completed, but the trip planned was within budget and within the time constraint.

### Task 2
This task was performed twice on our application, 
twice on Roadtrippers, and once on google.

#### Prototype
The prototype failed to succeed in all user tests.
The main failure point for this task was the start and end destination pickers. The prototype didn't display the updated selection of the users and this caused a great deal of confusion regarding the manual trip planning.

#### Roadtrippers
"Overwhelmed with options" 

100% Stayed within budget

50% Stayed within time

50% Completed the task

#### Google
100% Stayed within budget

100% Stayed within time

100% Completed task

### Task 3
This task was performed on the prototype three times and on Roadtrippers once.

#### Prototype
66% Stayed within budget

0% Stayed within the time constraint

100% Completed the task

One stated that it "Felt easy and enjoyable"

#### Roadtrippers
0% Stayed within budget

0% Stayed within the time constraint

100% Completed the task

### Closing Wrap-up
By far what the users liked the most was the explore page. Every user who answered what they like about the application responded with some feature relating to the explore page.

What users liked the least was the navigation and filters. They found it confusing and want it to be more straightforward.

Additional features requested would be navigation in app, help booking, and a rework of the car fuel cost.

## Conclusions

Though the user tests were hampered by the limited prototypes we did discover some interesting aspects, particularly in the results from the background questions. With google being our leading competitor we can look at the niches that they aren't fulfilling. Particularly in trip recommendations. If we expand and develop our explore page to more easily display trips that people are looking for we can provide value to our users. Watching users attempt to construct a trip using Roadtrippers showed some flaws in the display of information they were doing as one user said they were "Overwhelmed with options" we should do further research into how we could best display the information the user is looking for with a focus on starting small and building up rather than the other way around. Seeing the scrolling list of options genuinely sparked excitement in many of the users. Focusing the application on short day trip recommendations from locals of the area would be an excellent avenue to pursue market research in. The prototype is flawed yet the concept intrigues users and there still isn't an application that satisfies the desire for an all-in-one road-tripping application.

## Caveats
Our main caveat is that we simply didn't get a wide enough breadth of users to test. All of the users were engineering college students who were taking a class about user experience. There was a complete and total lack of diversity.

Our secondary caveat is that due to the shortcomings of our prototype we relied heavily on the proctor to lead the user through what they might assume happens if buttons worked in a more obvious way.

Another caveat is that our user testing was done back to back with very short time constraints as users ran from test to test. Some tests were incomplete and thus there are some missing data points.

Finally, we have to caveat the fact that we are inexperienced in the art of proctoring these user tests and thus have likely missed many things said and done by the users that would've been of great value to our application, but due to time, stress, inexperience, and exhaustion we were unable to capture every detail to the level that we would've liked.
