# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing
### Written by Peter Menzies and Steven Mendez
Phase 3 of our research study involved conducting usability tests with participants to evaluate the user experience of our application. Before the study, participants were asked to sign a consent form, and completed pre-task questions about their travel history. This provided us with valuable information about the websites and tools they typically use for trip planning. The tasks we assigned allowed us to observe how the app flows and identify areas for improvement. Through this process, we were able to make adjustments to enhance the user interface and improve the overall user experience.

## Methods
For our study, we conducted usability tests with a total of five participants to evaluate every aspect of our application. The tasks we assigned were designed to cover different features of the app, including filtering options and the trip stats page. Through the tests, we discovered that some buttons and features were not salient. We also compared our app with a competitor's app, and found that users preferred the simplicity and lack of bugs in our app.

Task 1: Imagine that you are planning a road trip for yourself and your dog, with a maximum travel time of 10 hours from Sacramento, CA, and a budget of $1000 for gas, campsites, food, and other expenses. Walk me through how you would use the app to plan this trip.

The goal of this task was to evaluate the filters and map navigation features of the app. While the users were not able to make an actual itinerary or check prices, they were able to use the filters and trip stats page to plan a potential trip and estimate costs. We received feedback suggesting that it would be useful to have the option to save itineraries and check prices in the future.

Task 2: Imagine that you are taking a road trip with your significant other, stopping in major cities and towns along the west coast, visiting popular sightseeing spots and food stops. You have a budget of $3500, and you are driving a V6 Jeep Wrangler. The starting point is San Diego.

This task was designed to test the gas feature of the app, but we found that it was not easily accessible. Users also expressed dislike for the requirement to input their car's make and model, suggesting that it would be more user-friendly to estimate gas costs based on the average miles per gallon of the vehicle.

Task 3: Imagine that a friend from Colorado is visiting Los Angeles, CA, and you want to plan a fun outing for the day. You are not great planners, so try to quickly find something fun to do within a budget of $1000. Note the order of navigation and features used, as well as any mistakes or backtracking.

This task was intended to evaluate the explore feature of the app. We discovered that the button for this feature was not easily visible and required users to search for it in the menu tabs. Despite this, the feature was well-liked by participants, who suggested adding filters for budget, trip length, and group type.

## Findings
### Background Question 0: Have you ever planned a road trip?
All but one of the users had planned a road trip

### Background Question 1: What are some of the tools used to book, plan, or organize this trip?
100% of the users tested used google maps to plan their road trips as well as at least one other application, but there was no overlap between the other applications between users.
The other applications listed were:
- Cross country
- Ways
- Tangible maps
- Booking
- Airbnb
- LA

Only one priority was listed from the user testing and that was to have the tools from the application printable or accessible without internet access.

### Background Question 2: Are there any features you would have liked to have to help you with your search?
Overall there was a theme of wanting help with the things to do on the journey. One wanted things to do, and another wanted alerts mid-journey, but the theme of assistance in event planning was key.

One big quote from one is "Maps are not the same as a road-tripping app." Having everything in one spot easy to access and helping the user every step of the way appears to be a need in the market.

### Background Question 3: Was Cost on your mind when you were planning it?

3/5 users tested stated that price was on their mind during the planning of their trip.

### Background Question 4: Did you spend more than you thought you would?

0/5 users spent more than they thought they would.

### Background Question 5: (If they havenâ€™t planned a road trip) What type of road trip would you like to go on in the future?

No data was collected from this question

### Task 1:
Task one was run four times on our prototype and only once on our competitor Roadtrippers. 

#### Prototype
100%  Stayed within budget

This was fairly simple as people generally went for a simpler trip and didn't adventure too far out into an expensive trip. Perhaps in the future, we will either change the way this task is worded or remove this data point altogether.

50% were within the 10hr travel requirement

25% Completed the task

The only time this task was completed on the prototype was when the proctor took a more active role stepping in for the prototype to explain what theoretically should be happening.

#### Roadtrippers
The task was not completed, but the trip planned was within budget and within the time constraint.

### Task 2
This task was performed twice on our application, 
twice on Roadtrippers, and once on google.

#### Prototype
The prototype failed to succeed in all user tests.
The main failure point for this task was the start and end destination pickers. The prototype didn't display the updated selection of the users and this caused a great deal of confusion regarding the manual trip planning.

#### Roadtrippers
"Overwhelmed with options" 

100% Stayed within budget

50% Stayed within time

50% Completed the task

#### Google
100% Stayed within budget

100% Stayed within time

100% Completed task

### Task 3
This task was performed on the prototype three times and on Roadtrippers once.

#### Prototype
66% Stayed within budget

0% Stayed within the time constraint

100% Completed the task

One stated that it "Felt easy and enjoyable"

#### Roadtrippers
0% Stayed within budget

0% Stayed within the time constraint

100% Completed the task

### Closing Wrap-up
By far what the users liked the most was the explore page. Every user who answered what they like about the application responded with some feature relating to the explore page.

What users liked the least was the navigation and filters. They found it confusing and want it to be more straightforward.

Additional features requested would be navigation in app, help booking, and a rework of the car fuel cost.

## Conclusions

Though the user tests were hampered by the limited prototypes we did discover some interesting aspects, particularly in the results from the background questions. With google being our leading competitor we can look at the niches that they aren't fulfilling. Particularly in trip recommendations. If we expand and develop our explore page to more easily display trips that people are looking for we can provide value to our users. Watching users attempt to construct a trip using Roadtrippers showed some flaws in the display of information they were doing as one user said they were "Overwhelmed with options" we should do further research into how we could best display the information the user is looking for with a focus on starting small and building up rather than the other way around. Seeing the scrolling list of options genuinely sparked excitement in many of the users. Focusing the application on short day trip recommendations from locals of the area would be an excellent avenue to pursue market research in. The prototype is flawed yet the concept intrigues users and there still isn't an application that satisfies the desire for an all-in-one road-tripping application.

## Caveats
Our main caveat is that we simply didn't get a wide enough breadth of users to test. All of the users were engineering college students who were taking a class about user experience. There was a complete and total lack of diversity.

Our secondary caveat is that due to the shortcomings of our prototype we relied heavily on the proctor to lead the user through what they might assume happens if buttons worked in a more obvious way.

Another caveat is that our user testing was done back to back with very short time constraints as users ran from test to test. Some tests were incomplete and thus there are some missing data points.

Finally, we have to caveat the fact that we are inexperienced in the art of proctoring these user tests and thus have likely missed many things said and done by the users that would've been of great value to our application, but due to time, stress, inexperience, and exhaustion we were unable to capture every detail to the level that we would've liked.
