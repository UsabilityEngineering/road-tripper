## Caveats
Our main caveat is that we simply didn't get a wide enough breadth of users to test. All of the users were engineering college students who were taking a class about user experience. There was a complete and total lack of diversity.

Our secondary caveat is that due to the shortcomings of our prototype we relied heavily on the proctor to lead the user through what they might assume happens if buttons worked in a more obvious way.

Another caveat is that our user testing was done back to back with very short time constraints as users ran from test to test. Some tests were incomplete and thus there are some missing data points.

Finally, we have to caveat the fact that we are inexperienced in the art of proctoring these user tests and thus have likely missed many things said and done by the users that would've been of great value to our application, but due to time, stress, inexperience, and exhaustion we were unable to capture every detail to the level that we would've liked.
