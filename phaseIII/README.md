# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing
### Written by Peter Menzies and Steven Mendez
Phase 3 of our research study included gathering some participants to do a walkthrough of tasks that we created to see how our application would flow. Throughout this phase, we made a consent form that the test subjects had to sign before doing the study. The study consisted of 3 tasks and some pre-task questions regarding the history of traveling. The pre-task questions gave us insight into who the user was and their experience with traveling. This gave us an idea of the different websites they used to plan their road trip. The next tasks were given so that we could gain some insight into how the app flows and where the rough parts of the application were. We were able to recognize the parts that needed to be reworked in order for the user to have a better UI experience.

## Caveats
Our main caveat is that we simply didn't get a wide enough breadth of users to test. All of the users were engineering college students who were taking a class about user experience. There was a complete and total lack of diversity.

Our secondary caveat is that due to the shortcomings of our prototype we relied heavily on the proctor to lead the user through what they might assume happens if buttons worked in a more obvious way.

Another caveat is that our user testing was done back to back with very short time constraints as users ran from test to test. Some tests were incomplete and thus there are some missing data points.

Finally, we have to caveat the fact that we are inexperienced in the art of proctoring these user tests and thus have likely missed many things said and done by the users that would've been of great value to our application, but due to time, stress, inexperience, and exhaustion we were unable to capture every detail to the level that we would've liked.
