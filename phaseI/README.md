# Road Tripper Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs
### Written by Peter Menzies and Steven Mendez

## Methods
### Competitive Analysis
The competitive analysis explores the existing field of data and gives us an understanding of where the strengths and weaknesses of our competitors lie.

### Heuristic Evaluation of the application Roadtrippers' ability to calculate the cost of a trip
This Heuristic Evaluation gave us a deep dive into the viability of our primary competitor's ability to fulfill the need we are trying to fulfill in our first sprint.

### Personas and Scenarios
Personas and scenarios allow us to better understand the needs and usage of our application by putting a face and a personality to our users and running them through scenarios in which our application might be able to fulfill a need.

## Findings
### Competitive Analysis
* Primary competitor is an application named Roadtrippers which does almost everything we desire to do in a very clean and effective user interface that only has a few minor issues.
* Discovered that there were no good price calculations using any of the other applications.
* Discovered a valued feature on other applications is the ability to collaborate on the planning of a trip.

### Heuristic Evaluation of the application Roadtrippers' ability to calculate the cost of a trip
* Application failed to inform me satisfyingly the information which I was strying to discover.
* Application had no settings to determine the calculations for the cost
* Application was visually appealing with its landmarks and general theme to the map
* Documentation was non existant
* Application was not able to recover from errors without losing the trip on the accountless version.
* No hotkeys or shortcuts to improve the speed for more experienced users.

### Personas and Scenarios
* Found the need to be simplistic and easy to understand at a glance.
* Needs time-sensitive events and scheduling
* Needs easy collaboration and the ability to share trips.

## Conclusions
Our main point where we can give value to our users is in the cost calculation. The rest of our application's uses can be sufficiently met with the Roadtrippers application. This is not to say there aren't things we can improve on, but the need currently not being met satisfyingly or effectively by the applications available is cost calculation. The other main feature which is less of a priority, but still valuable is the ability to collaborate on road trips. This is a feature lightly touched on with other applications but they hide it behind a paywall.

## Caveats
Our main focus in the research was tilted toward this pay calculation feature which we desire. Our research into the reviews of the application showed no one mentioned the money calculations we still conducted the heuristic evaluation as though it were the main purpose of the application.

Our personas were not informed by any statistics or research. We simply made characters based on our feelings and personal experiences.
